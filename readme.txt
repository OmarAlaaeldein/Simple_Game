Description:
====================================================================================================================================================

This is a project for the course: CSE 313 Advanced Programming, Instructed by: Prof. Rami Zewail, in the Fall of 2020.

This is a simple turtle racing game, written in python 3, using Object-Oriented Programming,
design patterns, inheritance, modularity, and exception handling, where the user bets on one out of 4 turtles to win a race.

Using the following modules:
	
	1. turtle (used to obtain turtle shapes and create the game's GUI)
	2. random (used to randomize each turtle's chance of winning)
	3. tkinter (used to create the Game Menu containing buttons to start and exit the game)
	4. pillow (used to add images into gui for the launcher and game)
	5. sys (used to exit the game)

Each class and method was created with Object-Oriented Design guidlines in mind, like looking for object candidates
by defining a set of objects that will be helpful in solving the problem, and which have interesting behavior or
properties. For example, the turtles in the race are generated by the class "Racers" that contains common attributes of the turtles,
like colour, size, shape, and position.

Each turtle in the game has a random chance of winning the game, if the user's choice reaches the finish line first, they win, else they lose.
At the end of each game, the colour of the winning turtle is displayed on the screen.
Winning the game reads a winning message: "Nice", and losing reads a losing message: "You LOSE"



How To Play:
====================================================================================================================================================

To play the game, simply run the .py file, and the Game Menu screen will appear, then the user can start and close the game from there.
Once in the game screen, the user can choose a turtle to bet on, by simply clicking on or near the turtles location on-scren, then the 
turtles will proceed to race.
